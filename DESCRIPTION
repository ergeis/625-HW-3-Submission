Description: This function takes a data and a function input (in the form of y~x) and computes the coefficient estimates of a multiple linear regression model of response y on covariate/s x. Linear algebra and matrix multiplication are used to then find the standard error of the estimates, the test statistic of each estimate, and then the corresponding p-value for each coefficient.
